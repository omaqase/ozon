## About the Project
This is a personal project showcasing my skills in Golang and Next.js. The application is a full-featured clone of the OZON Marketplace, replicating its functionality and user experience.
This project serves as a demonstration of my expertise in modern web development technologies, particularly in full-stack applications. It also reflects my interest in exploring complex e-commerce systems.
Feel free to explore, contribute, or provide feedback!
